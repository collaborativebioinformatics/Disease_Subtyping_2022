  abstract = "Deregulated global mRNA translation is an emerging feature of
              cancer cells. Oncogenic transformation in colorectal cancer (CRC)
              is driven by mutations in APC, KRAS, SMAD4, and TP53, known as
              the adenoma-carcinoma sequence (ACS). Here we introduce each of
              these driver mutations into intestinal organoids to show that
              they are modulators of global translational capacity in
              intestinal epithelial cells. Increased global translation
              resulting from loss of Apc expression was potentiated by the
              presence of oncogenic KrasG12D Knockdown of Smad4 further
              enhanced global translation efficiency and was associated with a
              lower 4E-BP1-to-eIF4E ratio. Quadruple mutant cells with
              additional P53 loss displayed the highest global translational
              capacity, paralleled by high proliferation and growth rates,
              indicating that the proteome is heavily geared toward cell
              division. Transcriptional reprogramming facilitating global
              translation included elevated ribogenesis and activation of
              mTORC1 signaling. Accordingly, interfering with the
              mTORC1/4E-BP/eIF4E axis inhibited the growth potential endowed by
              accumulation of multiple drivers. In conclusion, the ACS is
              characterized by a strongly altered global translational
              landscape in epithelial cells, exposing a therapeutic potential
              for direct targeting of the translational apparatus.",

              metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In the confirmatory
              analysis, the primary end-point (non-inferiority of sequential
              therapy regarding time to failure of strategy, TFS) was not met.
              Nevertheless, significant differences regarding treatment
              efficacy were observed according to RAS status. Here, we evaluate
              the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) as additional biomarkers
              for sequential versus combination therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
              Gene expression was measured using NanoString after mRNA
              extraction from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour
              specimens. CMS were predicted using multinomial regression and
              correlated with updated data for TFS, overall (OS) and
              progression-free survival. RESULTS: CMS were predicted in 337 of
              421 (80.0\%) patients (CMS1: 18.4\%; CMS2: 51.6\%; CMS3: 2.7\%;
              CMS4: 27.3\%). CMS2 together with RAS/BRAF wild-type status was
              identified as potential predictive marker of benefit from initial
              combination therapy for OS (HR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.33-0.96, p =
              0.036) and progression-free survival (HR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.29-0.79,
              p = 0.004) and also trending in TFS (HR 0.63, 90\% CI 0.41-0.95,
              p = 0.066). In patients with RAS-mutated mCRC, CMS1 was
              associated with longer OS after initial combination therapy (HR
              0.43, 95\% CI 0.20-0.95, p = 0.038). Interaction testing
              (two-sided) of CMS and RAS/BRAF status in favour of the
              combination treatment strategy was significant for OS (p = 0.012)
              CONCLUSIONS: In patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC, CMS2 may
              serve as an additional biomarker of benefit from the initial
              combination therapy, including Iri. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial

              for the treatment of mCRC has yet to be defined. PATIENTS AND
              METHODS: In this exploratory analysis, patients were grouped
              according to the previously published tumor CRC-CMSs. Objective
              response rates (ORR) were compared using chi-square test. Overall

              438 out of 514 specimens available from the intent-to-treat (ITT)
              population (n = 592). Frequencies for the remaining 438 samples
              were as follows: CMS1 (14\%), CMS2 (37\%), CMS3 (15\%), CMS4
              (34\%). For the 315 RAS wild-type tumors, frequencies were as
              follows: CMS1 (12\%), CMS2 (41\%), CMS3 (11\%), CMS4 (34\%). CMS
              distribution in right- versus (vs) left-sided primary tumors was
              as follows: CMS1 (27\% versus 11\%), CMS2 (28\% versus 45\%),
              CMS3 (10\% versus 12\%), CMS4 (35\% versus 32\%). Independent of
              the treatment, CMS was a strong prognostic factor for ORR (P =
              0.051), PFS (P < 0.001), and OS (P < 0.001). Within the RAS
              wild-type population, OS observed in CMS4 significantly favored
              FOLFIRI cetuximab over FOLFIRI bevacizumab. In CMS3, OS showed a
              trend in favor of the cetuximab arm, while OS was comparable in
              CMS1 and CMS2, independent of targeted therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CMS

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent whole genome characterizations of
              primary human bladder cancers revealed that they can be grouped
              into ``intrinsic'' basal and luminal molecular subtypes. Here, we
              provide an overview of the subtypes and discuss their biological
              and clinical properties. RECENT FINDINGS: Basal cancers are
              characterized by advanced stage and metastatic disease at
              presentation. They tend to be enriched with squamous and small
              cell/neuroendocrine features and inactivating mutations and
              deletions of TP53 and RB1. Basal cancers can be divided into
              ``epithelial'' and ``mesenchymal'' (also known as ``claudin
              low'') subsets, and a portion of the latter form a
              ``neuroendocrine/neuronal'' subset that is associated with
              particularly poor survival. Luminal cancers are often enriched
              with papillary histopathological features and activating
              mutations in FGFR3, and they can also be divided into additional
              subsets based on differential stromal cell infiltration, relative
              genomic instability, and high- versus low-level expression of
              carcinoma in situ (CIS) gene expression signatures. Importantly,
              the bladder cancer molecular subtypes display differential
              sensitivities to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immune checkpoint
              blockade, and preliminary data also suggest that they respond
              differently to radiation with or without hypoxia modulation.
              Ongoing studies are investigating the relevance of the molecular
              subtypes to the bladder cancer histopathological variants and to
              upper tract urothelial cancer. The bladder cancer molecular
              subtypes were associated with different prognoses and responses
              to conventional and targeted therapies in retrospective studies.
              If validated in prospective studies, molecular subtyping will be
              integrated into bladder cancer clinical management.",

              gene expression profiling was done on 285 serous and endometrioid
              tumors of the ovary, peritoneum, and fallopian tube. K-means
              clustering was applied to identify robust molecular subtypes.
              Statistical analysis identified differentially expressed genes,
              pathways, and gene ontologies. Laser capture microdissection,
              pathology review, and immunohistochemistry validated the
              array-based findings. Patient survival within k-means groups was
              evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Class prediction
              validated k-means groups in an independent dataset. A
              semisupervised survival analysis of the array data was used to
              compare against unsupervised clustering results. RESULTS: Optimal
              clustering of array data identified six molecular subtypes. Two
              subtypes represented predominantly serous low malignant potential
              and low-grade endometrioid subtypes, respectively. The remaining
              four subtypes represented higher grade and advanced stage cancers
              of serous and endometrioid morphology. A novel subtype of
              high-grade serous cancers reflected a mesenchymal cell type,
              characterized by overexpression of N-cadherin and P-cadherin and
              low expression of differentiation markers, including CA125 and
              MUC1. A poor prognosis subtype was defined by a reactive stroma

              four previously described molecular classifications of colorectal
              cancer defined in non-metastatic patients also correctly classify
              stage IV patients. One of the classifications is strongly
              associated with response to FOLFIRI (P=0.003), but not to FOLFOX
              (P=0.911) and FOLFIRI + Bevacizumab (P=0.190). In particular, we
              identify a molecular subtype representing 28\% of the patients
              that shows an exceptionally high response rate to FOLFIRI
              (87.5\%). These patients have a two-fold longer overall survival
              (40.1 months) when treated with FOLFIRI, as first-line regimen,
              instead of FOLFOX (18.6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              demonstrate the interest of molecular classifications to develop
              tailored therapies for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
              and a strong impact of the first-line regimen on the overall
              survival of some patients. This however remains to be confirmed
              in a large prospective clinical trial.",

              led to identification of four consensus molecular subtypes
              (CMS1-4), which have prognostic value in stage II/III disease.
              More recently, the Colorectal Cancer Intrinsic Subtypes (CRIS)
              classification system has helped to define the biology specific
              to the epithelial component of colorectal tumors. However, the
              clinical value of these classifications in predicting response to
              standard-of-care adjuvant chemotherapy remains unknown. PATIENTS
              AND METHODS: Using samples from 4 European sites, we assembled a
              novel stage II/III CRC patient cohort and performed
              transcriptomic profiling on 156 samples, targeted sequencing and
              generated a tissue microarray to enable integrated
              ``multi-omics'' analyses. We also accessed data from 2 published
              stage II/III CRC patient cohorts: GSE39582 and GSE14333 (479 and
              185 samples respectively). RESULTS: The epithelial-rich CMS2
              subtype of CRC benefitted significantly from adjuvant
              chemotherapy treatment in both stage II and III disease (p=0.02
              and p<0.0001 respectively), while the CMS3 subtype significantly
              benefitted in stage III only (p=0.00073). Following CRIS
              sub-stratification of CMS2, we observed that only the CRIS-C
              subtype significantly benefitted from adjuvant chemotherapy in
              stage II and III disease (p=0.0081 and p<0.0001 respectively),
              while CRIS-D significantly benefitted in stage III only
              (p=0.0034). We also observed that CRIS-C patients with low levels
              of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were most at risk of
              relapse in both stage II and III disease (p=0.0031). CONCLUSION:
              Patient stratification using a combination of transcriptional
              subtyping and CD8 immunohistochemistry analyses is capable of
              identifying poor prognostic stage II/III patients who benefit
              from adjuvant standard-of-care chemotherapy. These findings are
              particularly relevant for stage II disease, where the overall
              benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is marginal.",

              initially described in early-stage cohorts, but the associations
              of CMS with treatment outcomes in the metastatic setting are yet
              to be established. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic
              impact of CMS classification and its predictive effects for
              bevacizumab benefit in metastatic CRC by correlative analysis of
              the AGITG MAX trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MAX trial
              previously reported improved progression-free survival (PFS) for
              the addition of bevacizumab (B) to chemotherapy [capecitabine
              (C)$\pm$mitomycin (M)]. Archival primary tumours from 237
              patients (50\% of trial population) underwent gene expression
              profiling and classification into CMS groups. CMS groups were
              correlated to PFS and overall survival (OS). The interaction of
              CMS with treatment was assessed by proportional hazards model.
              RESULTS: The distribution of CMS in MAX were CMS1 18\%, CMS2
              47\%, CMS3 12\%, CMS4 23\%. CMS1 was the predominant subtype in
              right-sided primary tumours, while CMS2 was the predominant
              subtype in left-sided. CMS was prognostic of OS (P = 0.008), with
              CMS2 associated with the best outcome and CMS1 the worst. CMS
              remained an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate
              analysis. There was a significant interaction between CMS and
              treatment (P-interaction = 0.03), for PFS, with hazard ratios
              (95\% CI) for CB+CBM versus C arms in CMS1, 2, 3 and 4: 0.83
              (0.43-1.62), 0.50 (0.33-0.76), 0.31 (0.13-0.75) and 1.24

              found that CMS stratified OS outcomes in metastatic CRC

              CMS groups distinct from those previously reported in early-stage

              PATIENTS AND METHODS: CALGB/SWOG 80405 is a phase III trial that
              compared the addition of bevacizumab or cetuximab to infusional
              fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin or fluorouracil,

              patients enrolled in this study to assess the prognostic and

              highly prognostic for overall survival (OS; P < .001) and
              progression-free survival (PFS; P < .001). Furthermore, CMSs were
              predictive for both OS (P for interaction < .001) and PFS (P for

              subtype (CMS) has been validated to be a prognostic tool for
              CRCs. In this study, CMS status was investigated as a prognostic
              biomarker for the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II
              colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tissue microarray
              was retrospectively constructed of 165 nonconsecutive, primary,
              and sporadic stage II CRCs. CMS status was determined by
              immunohistochemistry staining of CDX2, HTR2B, FRMD6, and ZEB1,
              combining with microsatellite instability testing. The prognostic
              for adjuvant chemotherapy efficacy of CMS status was calculated
              by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis. Subgroup
              analyses were conducted according to tumor location. RESULTS:
              Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that CMS was associated with
              overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival for stage II
              CRCs. Cox regression analysis showed that CMS was an independent
              risk factor for OS. Among high-risk clinicopathological factors,
              patients with CMS2/3 (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.445, 95\% confidence
              interval [CI]: 0.227-0.875), left-sided tumors (HR: 0.488, 95\%
              CI: 0.247-0.968), or fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined (HR:
              0.307, 95\% CI: 0.097-0.974) had survival benefit from adjuvant
              chemotherapy. Subgroup analysis showed that adjuvant chemotherapy
              only improved OS for patients with left-sided tumors of CMS2/3
              subtype. Regardless of CMS, right-sided tumors had no benefit
              from adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: CMS is a better
              prognostic factor for adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II CRCs.
              Together with tumor location, CMS classification will aid in
              personalized treatment for stage II CRCs. IMPLICATIONS FOR
              PRACTICE: For stage II colorectal cancer (CRC), the efficacy of
              adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial, in that its minimal
              benefit (no more than 5\% on average) is considered not worth the
              toxic effects of the drugs. There are still no effective
              prognostic and predictive biomarkers. This study showed that
              consensus molecular subtype (CMS) status is a predictive marker
              for adjuvant chemotherapy efficacy. Patients with left-sided
              tumors of CMS2/3 subtype have survival benefit by receiving
              adjuvant chemotherapy, which will aid in personalized treatment
              for stage II CRCs. Moreover, this test of CMS based on
              immunohistochemistry is cheap, not time consuming, and easily
              conducted in the laboratories of most hospitals.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of colorectal
              cancer (CRC) capture tumor heterogeneity at the gene-expression
              level. Currently, a restricted number of molecular features are
              used to guide treatment for CRC. We summarize the evidence on the
              clinical value of the CMSs. METHODS: We systematically identified
              studies in Medline and Embase that evaluated the prognostic and
              predictive value of CMSs in CRC patients. A random-effect
              meta-analysis was performed on prognostic data. Predictive data
              were summarized. RESULTS: In local disease, CMS4 tumors were
              associated with worse overall survival (OS) compared with CMS1
              (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.28, 95\% confidence interval = 1.27 to
              8.47) and CMS2 cancers (HR = 2.60, 95\% confidence interval =
              1.93 to 3.50). In metastatic disease, CMS1 consistently had worse
              survival than CMS2-4 (OS HR range = 0.33-0.55; progression-free
              survival HR range = 0.53-0.89). Adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II
              and III CRC was most beneficial for OS in CMS2 and CMS3 (HR range
              = 0.16-0.45) and not effective in CMS4 tumors. In metastatic CMS4
              cancers, an irinotecan-based regimen improved outcome compared
              with oxaliplatin (HR range = 0.31-0.72). The addition of
              bevacizumab seemed beneficial in CMS1, and anti-epidermal growth
              factor receptor therapy improved outcome for KRAS wild-type CMS2
              patients. CONCLUSIONS: The CMS classification holds clear
              potential for clinical use in predicting both prognosis and
              response to systemic therapy, which seems to be independent of
              the classifier used. Prospective studies are warranted to support
              implementation of the CMS taxonomy in clinical practice.",

              different subtypes are likely to respond differently to
              treatments. However, to date, there is no clinical diagnostic
              test for CMS subtyping. In this study, we used novel methodology
              in a multi-cohort training domain (n = 1,214) to develop the
              ColoType scores and classifier to predict CMS1-4 based on
              expression of 40 genes. In three validation cohorts (n = 1,744,
              in total) representing three distinct gene-expression measurement
              technologies, ColoType predicted gold-standard CMS subtypes with
              accuracies 0.90, 0.91, 0.88, respectively. To accommodate for
              potential intratumoral heterogeneity and tumors of mixed
              subtypes, ColoType was designed to report continuous scores
              measuring the prevalence of each of CMS1-4 in a tumor, in
              addition to specifying the most prevalent subtype. For analysis
              of clinical specimens, ColoType was also implemented with
              targeted RNA-sequencing (Illumina AmpliSeq). In a series of
              formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded CRC samples (n = 49), ColoType
              by targeted RNA-sequencing agreed with subtypes predicted by two
              independent methods with accuracies 0.92, 0.82, respectively.
